### Welcome to Avro Phonetic for Linux

**ibus-avro** is the port of popular [Avro Phonetic](http://www.omicronlab.com/avro-keyboard.html) Bangla typing method to Linux. This software works as an Engine (plugin) of [IBus](http://code.google.com/p/ibus/) and let users type in English and on-the-fly transliterate them phonetically to Bangla. 

**Notable features:**

* 100% compatibility with the current Avro Phonetic scheme.
* Support for preview window to see originally typed text right under the cursor.
* Dictionary support can predict and suggest phonetically similar words with correct spelling on the fly.
* Autocorrect support brings commonly used English words to Bangla (like, Facebook, download etc.) even with their original English spelling.
